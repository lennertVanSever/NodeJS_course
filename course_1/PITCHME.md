## What is NPM?
_Node Packaging Manager_
- Largest software registry
- The registry contains over 600,000 packages (building blocks of code)
- You can use these package or make one yourself!
---
## What is a package.json file?
source: [npm docs](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/using-a-package.json)
- Lists the packages that your project depends on.
- Allows you to specify the versions of a package that your project can use using semantic versioning rules.
- Makes your build reproducible, and therefore much easier to share with other developers.
---
## Initializing your package.json file
1. Initialize your project as an npm package
```
npm init
```
2. Open the directory you just created in your favorite code editor
3. Checkout your package.json file
4. In package.json add this to "scripts"
```
"start": "node index.js"
```
---
## Install a dependency
1. Go to [npm express package page](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express)
2. Install the package via the following command
```
npm install express --save
```
3. Create .gitignore file with the following content
```
node_modules/
```
---
## Setup your server
```
const express = require('express')
const server = express();

const PORT = 8000;

server.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Example app listening on port ${PORT}!`)
});

server.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello World!')
});
```
---
## Install nodemon
1. Install [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) as a dev dependency
```
npm install --save-dev nodemon
```
2. In package.json add this to "scripts":
```
"start": "nodemon index.js"
```
3. Now node will restart everytime you make a change to a file

## Let's have some fun!
1. Print a variable specified in a route by the user (google is your friend!)
2. Print the desired result of the following route: _/\<number\>/plus/\<number\>/is_
3. Convert the result of exercise 3 into cardinal numbers. For example 3 -> three, 6 -> six (use a npm package)
4. Print an error if a string and not a number is given in exercise 3. [Hint](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10563644/how-to-specify-http-error-code)
5. Send an email to an address via the following route _/sendmail/\<to\>_ ([NodeMailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) can be used to send a test email)
